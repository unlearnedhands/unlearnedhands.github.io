<h1 id="a-threat-model-of-sars-cov-2-and-interventions-to-reduce-transmission">A Threat Model of SARS-CoV-2, and Interventions to Reduce Transmission</h1>
<p>Adaptive responses to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 have been hampered by unclear, conflicting signals from various sources.  This cacaphony is expectable during a disruption that is still unfolding and has many unknowns, but as of June 1 2020 there is a stable body of knowns concerning viral transmission.  These knowns can be composited into a stable picture of the nature of the threat from this virus, which is necessary to inform sound decision making for individuals, institutions, cities and states.</p>
<p>A pandemic is a paradigm case of a threat that requires coordinated response among many people over time and space.  Effective coordination in such conditions requires a body of common knowledge which is shared by all participants.  Information dispersed among many people but not integrated into the common knowledge base is to that extent useless or even detrimental, since it can lead to different parties operating at cross-purposes.  What effectively guides collective behavior is not merely the known, but the &#39;known known&#39; -- what everyone knows that everyone knows.</p>
<p>This document is intended as a step toward effective common knowledge about SARS-CoV-2; it is not a policy document or a report of novel findings, but a framework that can be used as a guide in interpreting new information as it appears, and to orient decisions about risk.  Some broad suggestions about interventions are made based on demonstrated effectiveness, on the understanding that they will need tailoring to the unique circumstances that each community faces.</p>
<p><strong>I.  Population Dynamics of Transmission: Dispersed Spread</strong></p>
<p>In early February of 2020, researchers at Johns Hopkins University published a report of calculations based on Chinese outbreak data, showing that the observed pattern of spread for SARS-CoV-2 implied a high degree of skew in the distribution of viral transmissions.  This group calculated that ~10% of infected cases were the vectors for ~80% of secondary infections [1].  Their methods were based on earlier work which had shown a similar pattern for the coronavirus SARS-CoV-1 in 2005, where ~16% of infected cases were the vectors for ~80% of the transmissions. [2]  </p>
<p>In the following months, as outbreaks appeared across the globe, this same result has been corroborated by multiple different research groups using different data sets and different methods.  In late February 2020, one group from the London School of Hygeine and Tropical Medicine used outbreak data collected worldwide to arrive at an identical fraction of ~10% of infected cases as vectors for ~80% of transmission events. [3]  In early May 2020, another group at the University of Hong Kong examined outbreaks in Hong Kong and found likewise that the evidence was consistent with ~20% of infected cases being vectors for ~80% of transmissions. [4]</p>
<p>Convergent results were arrived at by another group using a distinct approach, also in early May 2020, based on collected samples of viral RNA taken from confirmed infected cases in Israel.  Sequencing of the viral RNA afforded a reconstruction of the transmission path of the virus through the population; the observed mutation patterns in the virus were consistent with a history in which less than 10% of infected cases were vectors for 80% of transmissions. [5]  The convergence of independent groups of researchers using different data sets and different methods upon similar results show the robustness of this overall pattern. </p>
<p>These lines of evidence converge on a pattern where the majority of infections with SARS-CoV-2 lead to either zero secondary infections or only one, and a minority of cases cause the overwhelming majority of transmissions.  This skew in the distribution of secondary infections is referred to as <em>dispersion of transmission</em>, or colloquially as the Typhoid Mary effect.  It&#39;s also been documented in studies of sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea and HIV, where the utility of examining a person&#39;s network of contacts in order to analyze and prevent spread is more obvious than in the case of more common illnesses such as influenza.</p>
<p>This characteristic raises the possibility of tightly focused interventions, and increases the utility of mapping the network of spread for optimally targetting these interventions.  In a strongly dispersed transmission network, optimal intervention amounts to &#39;chopping the tail&#39; of the distribution of transmissions by identifying sources of infection with a large number of contacts, and which act as central points of transmission between local network clusters. [6]  If we decrease the number of contacts per person and lower the number of contacts between groups of people, spread can be slowed dramatically and isolated outbreaks can &#39;burn out&#39;. </p>
<p><strong>II.  Temporal Dynamics of Transmission: Presymptomatic Spread</strong></p>
<p>In late January 2020, a member of the Institute for Disease Modeling in Washington state made a preliminary estimate of the time from infection to symptom onset in a sample of 63 infected cases.   The median incubation period (from infection to symptom onset) was around 5 days, with 95% of cases falling in an interval of 2 to 14 days. [7]  This estimate was confirmed by another study from the Chinese CDC published concurrently. [8] </p>
<p>Based on reconstructions of chains of transmission, by the end of February it had become clear that people who would later develop symptoms were transmitting the virus for days prior to symptom onset.  In early March 2020, researchers from Hong Kong university used incubation data and repeated throat swabs from infected cases to construct a timeline for transmissibility of the virus.  They estimated, first, that infectiousness preceded onset of symptoms by a mean of ~2 days prior to symptom onset and peaked around the time of symptom onset, and secondly that the median serial interval in chains of infection was ~5 days -- that is, close to half (44%) of all transmission events occurred prior to onset of symptoms. [9]  </p>
<p>Subsequent estimates suggested rates of presymptomatic spread even higher than this: one meta-analysis of 1251 cases published in May 2020 estimated rates of presymptomatic spread at ~68%. [10] Another team studying spread within China combined epidemiological data with mobility data and inferred an even higher rate of symptomatic spread: in a paper published in early May 2020, they estimated that ~78% of secondary transmission events in China prior to the introduction of travel restrictions occurred while the primary infectious case was asymptomatic or presymptomatic. [11]   A German study of variation in viral shedding over time showed viral concentrations in saliva varying over a span of eight orders of magnitude in the course of infection, peaking around the day of symptom onset. [12]</p>
<p>This creates a problem for control of transmissions, because it implies that the virus is always one step ahead of its diagnosis.  In early May 2020, two papers were published which quantified this problem.  First, a group at Oxford showed that even if all symptomatic cases were identified and quarantined immediately, presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases alone could suffice to keep the infection growing exponentially. [13] Second, a group at Johns Hopkins did a pooled analysis of 7 studies of repeated RT-PCR tests for viral RNA in upper respiratory tract, taking multiple swabs from the same cases over the duration of their infection.  They found that on day 4 after infection (~1 day prior to mean time of symptom onset), the chance of a false negative on the test was still 67%; this fell to a minimum of 20% on day 8 (~3 days after mean time of symptom onset). [14]  </p>
<p>Three studies on patients reporting no overt symptoms at the time of a positive RT-PCR test have shown that in nearly all such cases a chest CT scan reveals ground-glass opacities characteristic of symptomatic individuals, and indicative of what has been called &#39;walking pneumonia&#39;. [15] [16] [17]  Several analyses have also shown that at time of symptom onset, a chest CT scan has higher sensitivity (but lower specificity) to detect infection with SARS-CoV-2 than RT-PCR test; this makes a valuable diagnostic tool in areas where the virus is common and RNA tests are limited, and the Japanese government has successfully used chest CT as a frontline diagnostic in outbreak areas. [18] [19] [20]  But none of these options allows us to get ahead of the presymptomatic spread. </p>
<p>Combining all these results, we find that there is no currently available diagnostic that allows us to reliably get ahead of the presymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2.  Rapid, repeated universal testing and isolation of cases has been proposed as a way around this problem, since if it can at least catch some large fraction of presymptomatic cases the reproduction rate may be brought below the critical value necessary for driving the virus to extinction in the population; however, this strategy depends on assumptions about the sensitivity of the tests to detect such cases which may not be met if the above analyses are accurate. [21]  As the authors point out, the value of mass testing is additive with other interventions, and even if it remains insufficient by itself, in conjunction with others it may offer effective control of transmission.</p>
<p><strong>III.  Loci of Infection: Nasal Passages and Lungs</strong></p>
<p>If we ask how virions from an infected person leave their body, there are two possibilities: from the mouth or from the anus.  We can discount the latter route for two reasons.  First, SARS-CoV-2 virions have been shown to be rapidly inactivated by colonic fluid [22]; second, in a study of 205 hospital patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, while viral RNA shedding in stool was typical, only in 2 out of 205 cases could &#39;live&#39; intact virus be isolated from stool. [23]  The distinction is important, because viral RNA can&#39;t by itself gain access to cells and can be safely treated as &#39;inert&#39;; in the aftermath of an infection, damaged tissues containing viral detritus need to be eliminated from the body, and this process can take weeks or months.  While the fecal route may be one mechanism of transmission in a minority of cases, and it has been shown that flushing toilets generates plumes of aerosolized fecal matter [24], in quantitative terms this pathway is unlikely to account for a significant portion of spread.</p>
<p>If we ask how virons enter the body of an uninfected person, the main entry points are the mouth and nose. The eyes may be another indirect route of access, since the tear ducts connect with the sinuses, but in an experiment on macaques showed that a very large viral dose (about one million virions) administered to the eye only resulted in a very mild infection. [25]  Again, the ocular surface can&#39;t be entirely dismissed as a hazard, particularly for medical workers, but in numeric terms it cannot account for a significant proportion of viral spread. </p>
<p>We can refine the attack surface even further by inquiring after which cell types are the ideal targets for SARS-CoV-2.  It&#39;s known that the virus enters via the ACE2 receptor, but that this entry is limited by the presence of the proteases TMPRSS2 and Furin, in the absence of which the virus doesn&#39;t bind effectively to ACE2. [26] [27]  </p>
<p>The degree of co-expression of all three of these proteins in a cell type is thus what marks that cell as a specific target for SARS-CoV-2, and April 2020 a group at the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology assayed a large range of cell types to determine from mRNA and protein expression which cells fell into this category. [28]  They found that at the very top of the risk list were alveolar type II cells and macrophages in the lung; other high-risk cells included cardiomyocytes in the heart, followed distantly by enterocytes in the intestine and proximal tubules in the kidney.  This biochemical risk-ranking tracks very well with the observed rates of clinical morbidities in SARS-CoV-2 infection: nearly all cases show pneumonia, while a smaller number show heart damage, and a still smaller number show intestinal and kidney damage. </p>
<p>Another group in Tokyo performed a similar analysis on the nasal passages, and confirmed that the same trio of factors were present in the respiratory and olfactory mucosa in the nose; they propose this as an explanation for the frequent presentation of loss of sense of smell as an early symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection (present in ~53% of cases). [29]  </p>
<p>Thus there seem to be two principal targets for initial infection: the nasal cavity and the lungs.  However, tissues in the upper airway also highly express many proteins involved in innate immunity, which is to be expected based on their being the &#39;front line&#39; of exposure for many types of infection. [30]  This would at least raise the possibility that the upper airway is a less favorable target environment than the lower airway.  Consistent with this, a group at Beijing found in March 2020 that in comparing three methods of sampling for viral load, nasal swabs yielded hundreds viral RNA copies per test, throat swabs yielded thousands of copies per test, and sputum from the lower airways yielded tens of thousands of copies per test. [31]  This overall pattern in which each step deeper into the airway yields an order of magnitude more viral RNA was confirmed in a meta-analysis of 3442 specimens by a group at Harvard in May 2020. [32]</p>
<p>The significance of this is that viral shedding can be used as a proxy for preferential sites of infection: all else equal, whichever sites shed the most will tend to be the sites where infection most easily occurs.  This would indicate that while the upper airway is a target of infection, the much more specific target is deep in the lungs.  A similar result has been confirmed in the case of influenza: the viral dose required to achieve infection is much greater in the upper airway than in the lower, indicating that penetration into the lungs allows greater infectivity. [33]  </p>
<p>This adds a further constraint to our reasoning about spread: the mechanism of spread must be likely to reach deep in the lungs, to the bronchioles and alveolae.  This would be consistent with the near-universal characteristic lung CT abnormalities and diminished oxygen saturation mentioned above.</p>
<p><strong>IV.  Mechanism of Transmission: Aerosolized Droplet Nuclei</strong></p>
<p>We can add further constraints on the basis of knowledge provided by contact tracing and reconstructions of spread events, which can help us identify conditions that raise the probability and degree of transmission.  In April 2020 a Japanese group analyzing 110 cases of transmission estimated the odds of transmission go up by a factor of ~19x simply from being indoors as compared with being outdoors. [34]  Another study released in the same month looking at 1,245 Chinese cases found only one single instance of transmission occurring outdoors. [35]  Another group in London did a literature review of 152 documented cases of transmission events where at least two people were infected, and found that the vast majority of them occurred in indoor environments. [36]  </p>
<p>So whatever the principal infection route is, it happens much more frequently indoors.  Based on the foregoing considerations, the most plausible route to consider is the airborne route.   There is a large body of work that allows us to quantify the risks of infection from this pathway with precision.  </p>
<p>In 1986, a group in Frankfurt performed experiments using radiological tracers to explore patterns of lung deposition for inhaled aerosolized particles smaller than 15 microns in diameter. [37]  Among other findings, they noted that no droplets over 10 microns in size made it as far as the alveolae; almost all droplets larger than this deposited onto the upper airway.  The reason for this is that smaller particles are less subject to inertia and have a lower probability of colliding with a surface in a convoluted air pathway, and hence a higher probability of making it to the alveolar end-point. The optimal particle size range for deposition in the alveolae was found to be in the range of 1 to 5 microns.  As a general rule, the smaller the particle, the deeper into the respiratory system it penetrates.</p>
<p>When breathing, speaking, singing, laughing, coughing, sneezing and all other forms of expiration, we generate a cloud of small droplets via air flow over our mucous membranes.  As a rough generalization, what holds on the way down also holds on the way up: the mean size of droplets we emit is inversely proportional to how far down in the respiratory system they originate, and the number of droplets emitted is proportional to the velocity of airflow. [38] [39]  Droplets larger than 50 microns in diameter drop ballistically to the ground, but droplets smaller than this can stay airborne for several seconds under normal atmospheric conditions; in practice, within one second they rapidly dehydrate into smaller droplets on the order of 1-5 microns, which can stay boyant in the air for hours. [40]</p>
<p>Droplet nuclei on the order of 1-5 microns are exactly the optimal size to penetrate all the way into the lungs to deposit in the alveolae, and these are exactly what the overwhelming majority of our exhaled droplets are.  A team at the National Institute of Health at Bethesda used a sensitive laser curtain to estimate the number of droplets emitted under normal speaking volumes, and found that an average of ~1,000 droplets per second were emitted (most in the range of 1-10 microns), with peak values of ~10,000 droplets per second for some sounds. [41]  Using  measurements of SARS-CoV-2 viral concentration from saliva, they estimated that in one minute of continuous talking a person can expect to emit around 1,000 droplet nuclei containing at least one virion.  These virions can persist in an aerosolized state for up to three hours without becoming inactive, with a half-life of just over an hour. [42]</p>
<p>This approach was elaborated further by a different group into a powerful framework for calculating emissions and exposures of SARS-CoV-2 via airborne droplet nuclei under a range of conditions. [43]  They define a quantum of viral load as the dose of airborne droplet nuclei required to cause infection in a susceptible person 63% of the time, and proceed to estimate the quanta emitted under various conditions of breathing.  For example, at rest one infected person simply breathing can be expected to emit one quantum of viral load per hour, whereas the same person (still at rest) speaking at a normal conversational volume can be expected to emit 100x more quanta per hour than when breathing.  Under conditions of heavy exercise, both of these values increase by a factor of 10x.  An infectious person running on a treadmill conversing steadily with someone next to them can expect to emit up to 1,000x the minimum dose necessary for infection.</p>
<p>The same paper illustrates how mitigating factors can be estimated using an example of an infectious person going into a shop.  Suppose an infectious person enters a small shop, walks around breathing for ten minutes, then leaves; if 15 minutes elapse and then a susceptible person enters the shop and does the same, their risk of infection is about 2.8% assuming the shop is unventilated; if mechanical ventilation is added (e.g. fans in windows or doors), the risk of infection to the same person drops to 1.2% due to the increased rate of replacement of infectious air with outside air.  The example is merely illustrative and the true values will vary, but the framework is adaptable and can be used to estimate the effect of various controls on the probability of infection.  Minimizing numbers of people, minimizing time indoors, and maximizing ventilation are simply the most obvious ways; others can be devised, but having the correct threat model and a way to estimate the effect size is an indispensible condition to divising them.</p>
<p>Another consideration that would impact risk is the existence of so-called droplet superemitters: a repeatedly documented finding in droplet-emission experiments is that a minority of people emit about 10x (or more) the number of droplets per second of breath or speech than the rest, in a bimodal distribution that sorts people into categories low-emitters and high-emitters. [44] One study found that 20% of participants were in this class of super-emitters, and that on the order of 12.5% of the participants were responsile for 40% of the total particles emitted while reading aloud.  [45]  This would go a long way toward explaining the high degree of dispersion in transmission: a superemitter would emit at least 10x the viral quanta of a low-emitter in the same span of time, making an infected droplet superemitter a viral super-spreader.  </p>
<p>It should be noted at this point that all of our major evidence vectors converge on aerosolized droplet nuclei as the dominant vector of spread for SARS-CoV-2.  If we had begun from this assumption, we would be able to derive all the observed results: </p>
<p>1) High dispersion of transmission is what would be expected from the high dispersion of droplet emission, as well as the high dispersion of indoor crowding events. </p>
<p>2) An abundance of presymptomatic spread is what would be expected if the route of transmission were a normal and frequent activity like speaking rather than an abnormal and infrequent activity like coughing and sneezing. </p>
<p>3) The preferred target surface of infection and locus of greatest viral load laying in the deepest portion of the lung speaks against against any other route of transmission being the dominant one.  </p>
<p>4) Probability of infection in an indoor environment with poor ventilation being much higher than in an outdoor environment with continuous airflow is what would be expected from a transmission vector which depends principally on suspension in air.</p>
<p>This is not to say that other routes of transmission can be declared impossible.  The argument is quantitative: other mechanisms of transmission are by themselves inadequate to explain the observed quantitative distributions at the level of populations, timespans, locations, and within the body of a single person.</p>
<p><strong>V.  Forensic Confirmations</strong></p>
<p>If aerosolized droplet nuclei are the main vector of transport, this predicts that long-range transport of infectious virus is possible.  One group collecting samples from air in hospitals in Wuhan found that air samples collected ~4m away from any patient beds contained detectable viral RNA. [46]  Comparable results were found in a Nebraska study that detected viral RNA in air samples taken both in the isolation rooms of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and in hallways outside these rooms [47], and a Singapore study that found SARS-CoV-2 positive aerosols of 1-4 microns in 2 of 3 patient rooms tested [48].</p>
<p>In-depth case studies of infection clusters originating from a call center in Seoul [49], a restaurant in Guangzhou [50], and a choir meeting in Skagit County [51] have all confirmed expired aerosolized droplets as the mechanism of transmission that most parsimoniously accounts for the exposure in each of these cases.  A CDC report on outbreaks in poultry and meat processing plants in the United States found 4,913 cases across 155 plants, a disproportionately high attack rate. [52] </p>
<p>This last case is especially instructive: meat packing lines have a high degree of internal air recirculation (which controls internal temperature more effectively at the cost of lower replacement of air), are cooled to refrigeration temperatures (which increase the survival time of coronaviruses to up to 14 days), and are very loud and therefore require shouting to communicate (which increases droplet emissions by a factor of ten). All of these factors plus a large number of employees in the same space would tend to exacerbate airborne spread, making meat processing plants an ideal environment for transmission of this type of infection.</p>
<p>One other point of confirmation, albeit a speculative one in the absence of high quality data, is the observation of a low attack rate at high-altitude (&gt; 3000m above sea level) locations. [53] This is in some respects an interesting test, since the relatively lower humidity and lower temperature of high-altitude should tend to facilitate rather than impede the transmission of coronaviruses; similarly, there is some evidence from other lower respiratory diseases that disease progression tends to lead to poorer outcomes at higher altitudes, due to low ambient oxygen. The authors of the paper which reported this finding offer several speculative explanations for which evidence is lacking, but there is a more parsimonious one available: lower air density at higher altitudes lowers the buyancy and decreases the airtime of airborne droplets.</p>
<p>VI.  Mortality and Morbidity</p>
<p>Best estimates of the infection fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 using worldwide data show that it kills approximately 1 in 100 people infected. [54]  This risk is strongly stratified by age: odds of death for cases in their 20s are on the order of 1 in 10,000, cases in their 40s on the order of 1 in 1,000, cases in their 60s on the order of 1 in 100, and cases in their 80s on the order of 1 in 10 -- that is, the odds of dying given an infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2 increase by an order of magnitude with every 20 years of life.  </p>
<p>Chest CT scans show a 97% sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 infection at time of symptom onset, indicating that pneumonia is a near-universal feature of disease progression. [55] [56] An early study of chest CT scans on a cluster of infected cases found that even among cases presenting with no fever or cough, the same characteristic ground glass opacities were observed at a rate of 50%, indicating that even a &#39;mild&#39; case may involve lung damage. [57]  A follow-up study on 36 recovered cases in Italy found that 58% of these still had chest CT abnormalities at a median of 47 days following the onset of symptoms, indicating that recovery time may be several weeks past remission of acute symptoms. [58]  </p>
<p>A well-documented feature of the respiratory effects of infection with SARS-CoV-2 is cryptic respiratory distress: lung mechanics are normal, but blood oxygen drops into hypoxemic ranges. [59]  Clinical studies have broken down symptomatology into two categories, in which 4 out of 5 of cases report only &#39;mild&#39; symptoms and 1 out of 5 present as &#39;severe&#39; (oxygen saturation &lt; 94%) [60], but given frequent reports of &#39;walking pneumonia&#39; -- where the infected person feels subjectively fine (unimpaired lung mechanics) but shows clinical hypoxemia on a pulse oximeter -- the distibution of pulminary impairment may be more continuous than this binary classification suggests.  In any case, recovery of &#39;severe&#39; patients showing acute respiratory distress is typically on the order of six to eight weeks, even with no other complicating morbidities.</p>
<p>In line with the relative risk ranking of tissues mentioned above, cardiac injury has been reported as the second most common tissue morbidity in hospitalized patients, with two early Chinese studies reporting a range of 7-29% of confirmed cases in hospitals having myocarditis, consistent with this being a characteristic symptom of &#39;severe&#39; cases. Acute kidey damage occurs in as many as 7% of cases. [61] [62] [63] [64] [65]  </p>
<p>Both the commonplace lung damage and heart damage (as well as potentially the less common kidney damage) in severe cases is believed to be caused by a hyperinflammatory response to the virus, called &#39;cytokine release sydrome&#39;. [66]  The distribution of severity of symptoms appears to be related to the relative balance of innate versus adaptive immune response, manifested at a cellular level by the balance of macrophages versus T-lymphocytes: low lymphocyte (lymphopenia) and high macrophage activity is an early and reliable predictor of symptom severity. [67]  The reasons for this are still unclear, but postmortem studies of deceased patients have shown that SARS-CoV-2 directly attacks macrophages in lymph nodes and spleen, which can be predicted to cause release of cytokines triggering lymphocyte cell death. [68]</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances of infection, a fast inflammatory response by the innate immune system gradually gives way to a slower, more specific response by the adaptive immune system.  But if the adaptive immune system is impaired by the same infection causing the primary damage -- as seems to be the case with SARS-CoV-2 targeting both alveolar type II cells and macrophages -- the inflammatory response does not draw down.  In severe cases, then, SARS-CoV-2 thus seems to turn infected macrophages into a Trojan horse, retarding adaptive immune response by decreasing T lymphocyte count and triggering a corresponding over-response of the innate immune system.</p>
<p>VII.  Viral Adaptation</p>
<p>SARS-CoV-2 is believed to have transitioned to humans from horseshoe bats via pangolins as an intermediary. [69] Newly invasive parasites are typically far from optimally adapted for transmission in the new host species, and consequently can be expected to undergo rapid natural selection following introduction to the new host; adaptations that will spread most early and rapidly will be those that facilitate transmission. [70]  </p>
<p>In accordance with this expectation, a group at Los Alamos demonstrated in May 2020 that a novel variant of the spike protein -- which allows SARS-CoV-2 to gain access to cells by binding to the ACE2 receptor -- appeard early on in the pandemic in Europe, and rapidly became the most common viral variant wherever it subsequently appeared. [71]  This finding was further analyzed by an Italian group who tested whether the observed frequency data were compatible with random effects, and found a negative result indicating natural selection on the spike protein; they also provided positive confirmation that the mutation modifies the conformation and mobility of the spike protein in ways that may facilitate cell entry. [72]  This would theoretically tend to lower the minimum viral dose necessary for successful infection.</p>
<p>This demonstrates the potential for dynamically evolving transmissibility, indicating that one can&#39;t safely assume that SARS-CoV-2 won&#39;t adapt further.  Furthermore, increases in the prevalence of the virus make adaptive evolution more likely by increasing the number of mutations and the possibilities of recombination among strains.  Risks associated with this can be mitigated by changes in our behavior which help to minimize the possibilities of transmission, ideally bringing the virus to extinction within the human population. [73]</p>
<p><strong>VIII.  Prospects for Large-Scale Interventions</strong></p>
<p>The most basic behavioral adaptation to minimize transmission is near-universal physical isolation.  This has the merit of being highly effective at stopping transmission, and the demerit of making a wide array of social and economic activity impractical, and is at best an emergency measure that may be used to reduce the doubling time of the pandemic in order to create opportunities for further interventions.  The exclusive use of this strategy was modeled under a range of plausible assumptions by a group at Harvard, and the results showed that under most scenarios cycles of repeated isolation and relaxation would be necessary merely to keep population prevalence below the threshold of ICU overcapacity, possibly for years. [74]  This same paper suggests the possibility of strong seasonal cycles in coronavirus transmission, which would tend to exacerbate spread in the winter.</p>
<p>Another group at Princeton modelling this type of intervention showed a further problem with it: the effect is highly sensitive to the timing of the intervention, and being even one week too late can negate most of the benefit of the intervention. [75]  Permanent, sustainable control measures that don&#39;t carry extreme costs and aren&#39;t sensitive to decisions about timing thus offer much more robust benefits than synchronized, population-wide isolation.  </p>
<p>A standard recipe for epidemic control is &#39;test, trace, isolate&#39; (TTI): suspected cases are given a test for viral RNA, interviewed by a contact tracer to reconstruct and provide information for any person they may have had close contact with in the previous week for further testing and tracing, and asked to self-isolate to prevent further transmission if they test positive.  This strategy involves iteratively chasing up the network of transmissions in order to terminate its expansion, and its effectiveness at controlling spread depends on the fraction of transmission events that occur before an infected case can be found, tested, and isolated.  If this fraction is low relative to rate of transmission, TTI is a highly effective strategy; if the fraction of missed transmission is high, other measures are required for containment. [76] [77]</p>
<p>A Royal Society research group has shown that the degree to which TTI can reduce transmission depends on three factors: 1) turnaround time between onset of symptoms and tracing of contacts, 2) rate of compliance with isolation among identified cases, and 3) degree of population coverage of a TTI surveilance system. [78] Factor (1) can be minimized by rapid testing (a time of one day or less is achievable with present technology) and a well-designed tracing database that allows tracers to collate information in real time; factor (2) can be increased by providing financial incentives for reporting and isolating as well as rendering the process transparent to the participants (e.g. by providing a public and frequently updated &#39;heat map&#39; of infection sites); factor (3) can be increased by regularly and proactively testing individuals who are at a high risk of being infected and infecting others -- health and social workers, retail shop and industrial plant workers, etc.  </p>
<p>Another way of improving the effectiveness of TTI along all three of these axes would be to make firms responsible for compliance: continuation of license to conduct business could be made contingent on all workers being tested once per week and providing sign-in sheets for all persons coming and going from the building.  Costs associated with this could be &#39;expensed&#39; in the form of a tax rebate to to the firm, and lost income to workers in isolation could be compensated for by automatic direct deposits from a government revenue agency.  </p>
<p>However, even under optimistic scenarios TTI is unlikely to be a sufficient strategy for outbreak control: its effectiveness highly sensitive to delays in the cycle of testing and tracing [79] and to noncompliance [80].  While it can be highly effective in the earliest days of an outbreak where the number of infected people is small, once the virus has already achieved a high degree of intrusion in the population the degree of coverage required is likely to strain the capacity for testing in ways that require supplementation by other responses. [81]  </p>
<p>Another simulation of contact tracing using real-world social mobility data taken from an English village showed that tracing became more effective and required fewer isolations the more quickly it occurred, indicating that faster turnaround time could limit problems with coverage and compliance. The same study also showed that outbreak size could be limited further by tracing not only primary contacts but also secondary contacts (contacts of contacts), but that this resulted in a very large number of quarantines (~30% of the population at peak) if testing capacity couldn&#39;t accomodate the larger number of contacts traced. As the number of individuals tested scaled up, the required number of quarantines scaled down. [82] This shows that increasing testing capacity increases the effectiveness of TTI, but still establishes that TTI by itself can at best slow the progression of the pandemic, not eliminate it. </p>
<p>All of these models estimate the effects and the limitations of &#39;top down&#39; interventions, and remain agnostic about mechanisms of transmission.  Given knowledge about the mechanism of transmisson as outlined above, a large array of bottom-up interventions become available, and can be rolled out at scale to supplement top-down interventions like TTI.  </p>
<p><strong>XI.  Sustained Interventions</strong></p>
<p>Sustainable interventions are possible which minimize transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and other airborne pathogens at relatively low cost, and which can be implemented by individuals, firms and institutions as part of normal activity.  One group of these consists of &#39;source and sink controls&#39; which reduce emission and absorption of viral particles, and another group consists of &#39;medium controls&#39; which reduce the quantity of viral particles in the intervening air between one host and the next.</p>
<p>The most obvious source control is to minimize exposure.  Moving from on-site work to remote work where practical is one example, as is moving from indoor to outdoor use of space where practical.  In general, risk of exposure is a function of the size of a shared volume of air, number of people sharing it, and time spent by each person inside it.  Increasing the first and decreasing the second and third is a general recipe for reducing transmission risk.  These risks can be quantified and used to set guidelines: for example, a small high-use elevator is a much higher risk environment than a spacious low-use stairwell, and more people at one time may safely be in a large warehouse than in a small shop. [43] [83]</p>
<p>A different kind of source control is to minimize the amount of droplets emitted.  The most obvious means of doing this is by not speaking: droplet emission from light breathing is lower than droplet emission from loud talking by a factor of ~100x, and the familiar &#39;library rules&#39; of no unnecessary talking (and whispering where speech is necessary) could be applied to a much larger range of enclosed spaces -- on public transit, in offices, etc.  </p>
<p>A less obvious way of reducing emissions which has demonstrated efficacy is by inhaling nebulized isotonic saline, which in one experiment diminished droplet emissions by 72% over a six-hour period following inhalation, due to altering the viscoelasticity of mucous in the airways. [44] [84] A simple &#39;saline inhaler&#39; with the same design as standard asthma inhalers could be given to anyone testing positive for SARS-CoV-2, and if taken every 4-6 hours could be expected to reduce their risk of infecting anyone around them.  Long-term health effects chronic administration are unknown, so this may not be suitable for the general population, but acute administration appears to have no ill effects; if administered for only one week after onset of symptoms it would have a large impact in reducing the risks of transmission in a clinical setting or in the home. </p>
<p>A more widely applicable form of source control is the widespread use of facemasks to obstruct or impede exhaled droplets.  A study from the university of Hong Kong in April 2020 found that surgical masks reduced the amount of detectable virus in exhalations by patients testing positive for a common-cold coronavirus (analogous in size and structure to SARS-CoV-2) [85], while a lab study carreied out at the Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois found that a bilayer cloth mask of dense-weave cotton could achieve a filtration efficiency on the order of 80% for respiratory droplets in the relevant size range. [86]  This latter study emphasized tight fit as a crucial performance factor, showing that loose-fitting masks lost up to 60% of their filtration performance from leaks.  </p>
<p>Mathematical modeling from a Chinese research group suggests that &gt;60% population adoption of masks with &gt;60% filtration efficiency could by itself reduce transmission enough to drive the pandemic to extinction. [87]  These results need to be interpreted with care, but are useful for developing a quantitative sense of the impact of the intervention.  An independent research group reviewed the existing evidence in favor of ubiquitous masking and found that the balance of evidence suggested surgical or cloth masks as a source control whose individual risk benefits are modest but whose population-level benefits could be large relative to their cost. [88]  This is another example of an intervention that could be adopted by individuals, firms and instutitions without need for government action.</p>
<p>&#39;Medium control&#39; measures can also be deployed to add to the effects of source control.  It&#39;s been known for over a hundred years that increasing indoor ventilation helps mitigate the spread of airborne infectious disease. [89]  In smaller rooms and buildings, opening windows and doors in temperate weather and using fans to increase air exchange with the outside can rapidly decrease the concentration of virus-bearing droplet nuclei if an infected person is or has been recently present, and in many larger buildings it is possible to close the recirculating dampers and open the outside air dampers fully in order to maximize the rate of replacement of indoor with outdoor air.  This has the disadvantage of increasing heating and cooling costs, but may simply be treated as part of the overhead cost of operations for the duration of the pandemic; if incentives are needed, one-time &#39;pandemic energy rebates&#39; could be offered by state authorities to offset costs.  </p>
<p>Installation of MERV-12 or higher quality air filters would also be a relatively low-cost intervention at the firm or institutional level that would remove a large number of droplets from the indoor air.  Coronaviruses also degrade more quickly at higher relative humidity, so increasing relative humidity to ~60% where practical would also tend to decrease spread while still limiting mold growth. [90] Another intervetion suitable for residential and commercial spaces is the use of portable air purifiers with HEPA filters, which filter out over 99.99% of all particles &gt; 0.3 microns and can filter on the order of 10 cubic meters of air per minute. [91]  </p>
<p>Another modification for high-use commercial, industrial and institutional spaces would be to install UVC lamps, which can sterilize air by deactivating viral RNA. [92]  This in fact was done as early as the 1930s to reduce the spread of measles and tuberculosis in hospitals and schools, and this technique is still used in water treatment today. UVC lamps could be installed at intervals of a few feet in high-use spaces, above 2m and louvered upward to prevent eye or skin damage to occupants, along with ceiling fans to ensure good mixing of the air and maximize sterilization.  Alternatively, or addionally, higher-wattage bulbs could be installed inside air vents themselves where eye and skin damage isn&#39;t a concern.  </p>
<p>The effects of portable HEPA filters and UVC lamps together would be additive, so the use of both might make it possible to re-open schools and other high-density, high-talking settings with minimal risk. </p>
<p>Localized means of outbreak detection are also possible even where testing capacity is limited.  Firms can screen employees for temperature with a thermometer and for oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter at the door each day, and retail businesses can require a name, address and phone number in order to facilitate contact tracing in the event of an outbreak.  It&#39;s been shown by a group at Yale that viral shedding in feces can be detected in sewage samples in the early stages of an outbreak, so weekly sewage samples can be taken at the building level or the district level as a substitute for RT-PCR tests for every occupant as an early-warning system. [93]</p>
<p>More speculative options for limiting the impact of SARS-CoV-2 are possible.  It&#39;s been demonstrated that recent exposure to a common-cold coronavirus leads to cross-reactivity in T-cells to the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which may afford accelerated response by the adaptive immune system to the novel pathogen; it has been speculated that this may help explain why there is such a dramatic variation in degree of symptom severity in the population, but this is far from being demonstrated at the time of this writing. [94]  But this at least raises the possibility that innoculation with a common cold may mitigate the degree of harm done by infection with SARS-CoV-2; further research would be required to decide this question. </p>
<p>Finally, the above line of thinking suggests a more extreme version: voluntary exposure to low doses of SARS-CoV-2 in clinically monitored isolation for young people with no existing medical complications. [95] The argument for this is based on the premise that higher initial viral loads correlate with worse symptom progressions, for which there is some evidence for many viruses and some weak evidence also for SARS-CoV-2 in particular.  The costs and benefits of this approach are at least relatively clear, and an argument could be made that it would be more humanitarian to give low-risk groups the option to be infected and isolated in a controlled setting than to let them risk unpredictable infection without isolation in an uncontrolled setting.  </p>
<p>In addition to moving the population closer to effective immunity with smaller margins of risk, one added benefit of this last approach is that it would increase the available supply of antibodies for use in serum therapy for serious cases, giving young healthy people the opportunity to make a small sacrifice that could save the life of an older, sicker person.  Liability concerns may impact the feasibility of this option, but liability concerns by definition are open to voluntary and informed waivers, and do not by themselves preempt over-arching concerns about mitigating immanent harm to those most vulnerable.</p>
